# Analysis-of-text-records

For this project, the main objective was to 
  - Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased
  - Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day
  - Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased
 
I am confident that this program helps solve the problem at hand. 
As far as my code, I believe I could have done a better job at calling for the input file. For example, instead of calling "CS210_Project_Three_Input_File"
    I had to call the entire path of the file.
The most challenging part of this code to write was correcting the call for the input file. For some reason it took me a while to call for the input file correctly.
The use of multiple languages, calling for an input file and outputting a menu for the program to work for the user are transferable to other projects as well due to the use of        multiple languages in other projects. 
In order to make the program maintainable, readable and adaptable, I left notes at, almost, every line in the code that way if the code needed to be reworked, it would be easier        to understand what is going on with the code.
